description: Kirk Munroe was a well-traveled writer and journalist who was born in
  Wisconsin, educated in Massachusetts, began his career in New York City, and finally
  settled in Florida. Once there, Munroe's proximity to Cuba likely influenced the
  point of view he employs in ""Forward, March"", a large part of which details the
  efforts of an American agent in Cuba during the war.
